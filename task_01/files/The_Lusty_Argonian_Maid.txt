7.  Lifts-Her-Tail: Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers. 
8.  Crantius Colto: Is that all you have come here for, little one? My chambers? 
9.  Lifts-Her-Tail: I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor Argonian maid. 
10. Crantius Colto: So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail. 
11. Lifts-Her-Tail: You embarrass me, sir! 
12. Crantius Colto: Fear not. You are safe here with me. 
13. Lifts-Her-Tail: I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not! 
14. Crantius Colto: Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here, polish my spear. 
15. Lifts-Her-Tail: But it is huge! It could take me all night! 
16. Crantius Colto: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.

25. Lifts-Her-Tail: My goodness, that's quite a loaf! But how ever shall it fit my oven? 
26. Crantius Colto: This loaf isn't ready for baking, my sweet. It has yet to rise. 
27. Lifts-Her-Tail: If only we could hurry that along. How would I accomplish such a task? 
28. Crantius Colto: Oh, my foolish little Argonian maid, you must use your hands. 
29. Lifts-Her-Tail: You wish me to knead the loaf? Here? 
30. Crantius Colto: Of course. 
31. Lifts-Her-Tail: But what if the mistress catches me? Your loaf was meant to satisfy her appetite. 
32. Crantius Colto: Don't fret, my delicate flower. I'll satisfy the mistress's cravings later. 
33. Lifts-Her-Tail: Very well, but I'm afraid my oven isn't hot enough. It could take hours! 
34. Crantius Colto: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.
